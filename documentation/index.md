# CXXHTTP

## Introduction

cxxhttp is a header-only implementation of HTTP, on top of asio.hpp, a
header-only asynchronous network communications library. And that pretty much
sums up the scope and theme of the library.

The library was originally written as a single header file, to prove a point I
was making [in a blog post, insinuating that FastCGI and all its spinoffs were
utterly pointless](https://ef.gy/fastcgi-is-pointless). While it did that well,
I found myself with some extra time at hand, so I decided to play around with it
and see how feature-complete I can make it while still sticking to that original
concept of having it be a header-only library.
